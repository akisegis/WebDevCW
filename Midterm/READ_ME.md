- As of right now, I have three pages that link together and resize. The main page features the most complete behavior. I got rid of the Statistics page from my proposal since linking statistics was not feasible at the time. In it's place, I created the home page that links to my IGN on the nav bar at the bottom. I achieved playing video from link by figuring out embeds and using them in the flex boxes I created. During this project, I discovered that I struggled with asides and formatting text.
- One takeaway I found was how to embed social media posts in flex boxes. If you create content for most popular social media sites, you can easily create embeds for your content that makes it so much easier to implement.
- If given more time, I would've cleaned up the media queries for the archive and about pages. One thing I struggled with in particular when doing my media queries for these pages was the bottom nav bar and the asides. I would also like to brush up on how to handle articles and pay more attention to the titles of the articles in the about page.
